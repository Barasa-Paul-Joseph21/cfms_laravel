Corporate Finance Management System
 It’s software that manages how money flows in and out of a company, keeps records, controls risks, plans future spending, and generates financial reports for decision-making.
Think of it as the digital CFO (Chief Finance Officer) of a business.
    • In small businesses: it handles invoices, expenses, payroll.
    • In big corporations: it handles investments, loans, compliance, financial risk, multiple subsidiaries, and global transactions.
