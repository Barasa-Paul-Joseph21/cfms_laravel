 CORPORATE FINANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.(Finance Flow).
A Corporate Finance Management System (CFMS) is like the brain + heart of a company’s money operations.
👉 It’s software that manages how money flows in and out of a company, keeps records, controls risks, plans future spending, and generates financial reports for decision-making.
Think of it as the digital CFO (Chief Finance Officer) of a business.
